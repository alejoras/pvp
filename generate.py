"""
PVP page generator. Derives a template from the hand-tuned Vanta flagship
(index.html) and stamps one personalized teardown per Tier-1 account.

This is the "engine produces assets at scale" proof: one template, N pages,
each built from the account's own Clay/ATS data. Vanta stays the canonical
flagship at root; generated pages land in /<slug>/.

Usage: python3 generate.py    (run from pvp-sample/)
Outputs: <slug>/index.html for each account in ACCOUNTS, + copies shared assets.
Data is real (role counts, titles, growth, logo) except the per-JD AI-readiness
scores, which are MODELED and labeled as such on every page (same as Vanta).
